this is the next iteration of the pubgjp site. gonna call it 'Sole Survivor: Isle of Extinction'. 

index.html will be the welcome page with a clickable button that runs a function called instructions(). The Instructions function will utilize jquery's .empty() to empty the html content from the body, and reappend the new html layout for the instructions and walkthrough using jquery's innerHTML() function. 

The instruction page should have a button to 'begin drop', which will be similar to the instructions() function, that we'll call gameOn(). It will again use jquery's .empty() to empty the body and innerHTML() to reformat the page so it's ready for the game.

then we drop the player off at the landing point/ armory to gather up supplies with the team. The rest of the team is slaughtered, and then it is just the player left alive.

each time the player changes location, we run a new function, that will update the output. 
This way, we can have a different enemy list for each area, to make the game more easily manipulated, and we can have a little more control over the overall difficulty of the game. we can also create a different weapon and item list for each area so you don't find a staple gun in the armory, but also don't find an AK in the office supply closet. each time we change location, we also want to update the map.

redo the svg of the map, and have each new location trigger the svg circle that represents that location change it's color to green
or find a better way to create a manipulatible map. 

briefing 1st draft-
    As you look up at the large, glass rotating doors of the BELO Corporation tower, you read the letter you received a few days ago:

    Greetings Lt. Pat Jenkins,
        We here at the BELO Corporation would like to thank you for you tenacity in going through our rigorous screening process. We realize and understand that most positions would not require six interviews (two of which required polygraph tests), two physicals, a pyschological evaluation, an in-depth drug screening, and twelve personal references who were each individually interviewed. However, we stand by our thorough screening process to ensure that we employ only the best, most qualified personnel. With that being stated, I am happy to announce that your application for the role of On-Site Security Officer at BELO Corporation has been approved. We would like to begin your on-boarding process as soon as possible; to that end, please report to our headquarters in Miami, Florida to meet with me on September 8, 1972 at 9:00am. It is recommended that you bring a suitcase packed with everything you will need for a two week deployment. We are very excited to bring someone with your background onboard as an asset to our team, and I look forward with meeting with you.  
                                           
                                            Head of Recruitment,
                                            Mr. Lucius Monroe

    You take a deep breath and then walk into the tower. After taking the elevator to the 34th floor, you walk down the hallway and enter a large office and see a young man sitting behind a large oak desk. He is in his late twenties, and is dressed in a sharp blue suit; His piercing green eyes shine behind black rimmed glasses, and his clean cut looks match his almost monotone voice. "Good Morning, Lt. Jenkins. I have been looking forward to meeting you. Today I will be walking you through the full responsibilities of your position. Please have a seat." He motions for you to sit in one of the highback chairs lined with black leather. "You have been hired to tour our new Island Reserve compound, assess any possible security risks to visitors or the creatures contained on said compound. We have hired two game guides who will lead you on your excursion through the park. From here you'll be taken to the docks to take a private ship with our mute captain. He's mute so he won't give away any secrets! hahaha!" "arent you afraid of him writing something down?" "oh shit,hadn't thought of that."

timeline-
war (1944) - Albert Belo sees 'brutality of man' with men in his unit gleefully killing all animals they passed, skinning them, and bringing home the pelts as trophies. He is horrified, and decides to dedicate his life to saving as many animals as he can.
post-war - 
-(1946) Johan Belo wins the lottery. And starts his own company focused on saving as many animals as he can. He names his company the 'Bodyguarding Endangered Lives Operation'. The goal of the company is to save as many endangered species as possible.
-(1946) Belo purchases large section land neighboring the everglades and converts it back into the everglades, they send several boats out and create floating labs on shallow bottomed pontoon boats. The main focus of these researchers are to identify endangered species and to use whatever means are necessary to ensure the survival of as many species as possible. Their main target was florida gators, as they were being harvested for their leather skin.
-(1951)After 5 years of successfully running the everglades refuge, BELO purchases a large section of amazon jungle, and creates tree houses with glass floors and walls, trying to get a closer look at the wildlife. These researchers followed the same steps as their Floridian counterparts, attempting to identify endangered species, and to assist them in any way possible. Their main target was jaguars, and golden eagles, both hunted to near extinction. This caused an impact on the monkeys in the amazon, and they would occasionally attack the treehouses.
-(1961) 10 years after the purchase of the amazon, Johan Belo takes his company public, and joins the board of directors.
-(1962) 1 year after the company goes public, a section of New Zealand is purchased, and bunkers are installed throughout the property, in an effort to minimize the impact of the researchers. These scientists did not do the same thing as their counterparts in Brazil and Florida. Instead at the New Zealand refuge, the scientists began analyzing the DNA structures of several of the creatures there, trying to find and isolate both the DNA of the Moa, and the lizard Megalania. They also begin to experiment with genetic cloning. 
-(1969) After 7 years, they are able to create a clone of small birds. 
-(1972) 3 years after that, they are able to clone lizards from scratch.  
-(1977) 5 years after the purchase and building of the New Zealand facility, BELO Corp. purchases a large section of land in Kenya. These scientists focused on collecting the DNA of more mammals to test their cloning techniques on. Their main targets are hyenas, white rhinos, and tigers
-(June 1979) Island Refuge purchased
-(Nov 1979) Animals moved to Extinction Island
-(Feb 1980) Haast Eagle is birthed using cloning on Extinction Island
-(Sept 1981) Haast Eagle goes wild, kills everyone on Island
-(Oct 1981) Player is sent to investigate the events on Island



Animals cloned :
florida- gator, egret, florida panther
brazil- jaguar, golden eagle, monkey
NZ- moa, megalania, haast eagle, 
Kenya- hyena, white rhino
